                <p>Location, location, location. It is not important whether the tent site is located in top of a
                    mountain or besides a lake in the middle of the forrest.
                    But to make it possible to locate the tent site and serve your tent site on the map, we need
                    the GPS information.

                    can help them make a decision of where to go camping. Be short and concise, we can see your photo.
